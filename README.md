This is a final project for my 2024 Discrete Strutures Class. The college I attend, Westfield State University was mapped out in the file, Westfield State Mapped Out,
it shows the distances and nodes that were used to create the program. This was a group project that included group coding and mapping out. The final project grade was a 95
as it was one of the more advanced projects presented in that class.
